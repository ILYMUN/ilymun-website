      <h4><strong> What is the ICJ ? </strong></h4>
      <p><strong>The International Court of Justice</strong> was created to act as a supreme
          <br /> judicial authority within the United Nations. It ensures global justice and safeguards nations’ sovereignty by settling
          <br /> legal altercations presented to it by the Member States. It does so by considering previous treaties, international
          <br /> conventions and international law.</p>
      <p>The ICJ at ILYMUN will help you view conflicts from a new perspective and will offer
          <br /> insight on international law and the proceedings of judicial cases. The ICJ is perfect for those interested in
          <br /> international relations, law or simply for those who want to try something new.</p>
      <h4>What is This Year’s Case ?</h4>
      <p>This year’s case centres on the ethnic persecution of the Rohingya people in the Rakhine
          <br /> state by the Myanmar Republic. This has resulted in the mass migration of almost 700,000 individuals into the area of
          <br /> Cox’s Bazar, in Bangladesh. Consequently, this persecution has caused major problems for Bangladesh, as they have to
          <br /> provide refuge for the Rohingya people.
          <br /> The two teams of advocates will represent the following groups :
          <br /> – Applicant party: Bangladesh
          <br /> – Respondent party: Myanmar Republic</p>
      <h4><strong> How Does the ICJ at ILYMUN Work ? </strong></h4>
      <p>The ICJ is composed of</p>
      <ul>
          <li>2 presidents</li>
          <li>2 teams of advocates; each team consisting of two advocates</li>
          <li>12-15 independent judges</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Both sides hold opening speeches to present both factual and legal evidence to the judges.
          <br /> The judges are given time to question the advocates.</p>
      <p>Next, each advocate team presents two to three witnesses. (Witnesses are approved by the
          <br /> Presidents of the ICJ prior to the conference.) Advocates are given the opportunity to interview witnesses and then judges
          <br /> can also question the witnesses or pose questions to the advocates regarding witnesses.</p>
      <p>Then advocates present closing statements. After this, the judges deliberate upon the information
          <br /> presented to them and compose a verdict expressing their judgment in the case.</p>
      <h4><strong> How do Advocates and Judges Prepare for the ICJ ? </strong></h4>
      <p><strong> Advocates </strong> need to research the case and create a report (called a memorandum).
          <br /> They also suggest a list of 3-4 witnesses they would like to have at the trial. Finally, they create an evidence packet.</p>
      <p><strong> The Presidents of the ICJ </strong> will work in partnership with the advocates to create
          <br /> and polish these documents and then post them on the ILYMUN website for judges to access. To access those documents, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181026101439/http://ilymun.org/committees/">CLICK HERE</a></p>
      <p><strong> Judges </strong> should read the documents posted by the Presidents of the ICJ to
          <br /> become familiar with the case, the witnesses and the evidence. It is expected that judges will act without bias, be reflective and innovative.</p>
      <p><strong> Presidents of the ICJ </strong> will also guide the judges in their deliberation to help them evaluate
          <br /> legal documents and assure the quality of the final verdict.</p>
      <h4><strong> How do I Sign Up for the ICJ ? </strong></h4>
      <p> Delegates who want to apply to the ICJ should be confident in their level of English. Advocates in
          <br /> particular should be confident public speakers.</p>
      <p> Due to the challenging nature and limited places for this committee we ask delegates to apply for a
          <br /> role in the ICJ, by <strong>submitting a letter of motivation</strong> which explains their previous MUN experiences and what makes them qualified
          <br /> for the role. Delegates should also state which role they prefer (judge or advocate) and if they are open to taking the alternative
          <br /> if they aren’t accepted for their first choice.</p>
      <p> Applications must be accompanied by a <strong>letter of recommendation</strong> from the delegates’ MUN Director. Send letters of
          <br /> application and recommendations by <strong><u>FRIDAY, OCTOBER 12</u></strong> or <strong>any questions</strong> about the ICJ to:
